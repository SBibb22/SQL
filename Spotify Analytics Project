# This project includes '2021 Spotify Top Song Data' that I downloaded from Kaggle. 
# Once downloaded, I created a table in SQLLITE, imported the csv table, and confirmed all the data had been loaded into the table.
# Finally, I began analyzing the data set using SQL commands.

## This first query allowed me to preview the dataset. Once reviewed I then answered the questions I came up with below.##
##SELECT *
FROM bit_db.Spotifydata
LIMIT 10;


## What is the average danceability by artist?

SELECT avg(danceability), artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name;

## What is the danceability for the 10 most popular songs?

SELECT danceability,popularity,track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

## Which artist released the longest song?

SELECT artist_name,max(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

## How many songs does each artist have on the list?

SELECT artist_name, count(track_id) as number_of_songs
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY number_of_songs DESC;
